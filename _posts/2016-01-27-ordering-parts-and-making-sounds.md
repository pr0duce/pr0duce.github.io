Fernando regailed us with tails from his youth of modifying a
soap-box car with a lawn mower engine. Thank god he never finished it.
He also fiddled with some button LED circuits.

Michael did some research on a DIY traffic counter, for counting bicycle
traffic around LA. There was a company that previosly published some
good resources to build your own pneuatic sensor under a Creative
Commons License, but they've [since been taken
down](http://tomorrow-lab.com/lab16). [Internet
Archive](https://archive.org) to the rescue!  In [early
2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116040732/http://tomorrow-lab.com/lab16)
they still had posted a [construction guide in English and
Russian](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116040732/http://tomorrow-lab.com/traffic_counter/traffic_counter_guide.pdf)
as well as the corresponding [arduino
software](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116040732/http://tomorrow-lab.com/traffic_counter/traffic_counter_software.zip). All the parts were order and should be here for next weeks work night.
