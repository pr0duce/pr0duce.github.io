Another night of producing!

Jon worked on importing Los Angeles County parcel and building data into
Open Street Maps. For those of you not into the obscure politics of OSM,
a bunch of data was lost, particularly around Los Angeles, when some
existing contributors did not agree to the new licensing terms adopted
by the project a couple years back. This has left [Los Angeles looking a
bit...
sparse](http://ksmapper.blogspot.com/2012/10/licensed-to-map-what-happened-to-la.html.html).
As well as restoring building outlines, the imported data will have lots
of rich data attributes like when the building was constructed.

Michael continued with his traffic sensor.  Thanks to Theodore from
[Tomorrow Lab](http://tomorrow-lab.com/lab16) for republishing the parts
list and original source code. I updated the code to work with modern
Arduinos and [published it on
github](https://github.com/pr0duce/traffic_counter).

This was especially cool because it was running on an Arduino that Colin
assembled. I'm impressed, but not surprised that he's such a neat
solderer.

Fernando showed off his progress with his
Jonny-5(node JS)/Arduino/Raspberry-Pi/Wireless/React-Native/iOS light switch.  It
is truly a thing to behold.
