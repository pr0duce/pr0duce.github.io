Big project of the night was pulling apart Colin's new espresso machine.

We extracted the boiler, and took apart some other inner parts, to be
soaked in citric acid, disolving mineral deposits from prolonged
exposure to tap water. This is [way more than you'd ever
need](http://www.amazon.com/Citric-Acid-Non-GMO-Organic-Chemicals/dp/B006STCVL8) for $17. I love buying chemicals on the internet!

Dinner was straight out of
