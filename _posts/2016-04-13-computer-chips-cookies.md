Continuing our ruthless War on Pizza, dinner was lentils and stewed
tomates, roasted vegetables, and kale grapefruit salad. Sound too
healthy? Scroll on my friend.

Doug is taking a Machine Learning course through <a

on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> the
software libre numerical computing platform.

Rachel, continuing her needlework, endeavored to make the cutest
birthday card ever. Sadly no photo is available at this time.

Fernando dumpster dove a LCD monitor, googled the model, and found that
they often suffer from blown capacitors. He and Michael took it apart
and inspected for bad capacitors. If your capacitor is bulging, it's a
good sign that it's done for. You can't easily test the capacitance
while it's in the circuit, so we desoldered and tested the bulging ones.
We found they were either totally dead, or way under spec. Ordering a
new set of capacitors was a whopping $6. The should arrive before next
hack night. We'll see if it worked!
