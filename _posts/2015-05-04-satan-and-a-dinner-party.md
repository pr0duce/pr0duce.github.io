This Tuesday marked another gathering of people making things, fixing
things, and learning about stuff.

Calvin, a new attendee at produce night and web programmer at JPL by
day, worked on a design for his [Munny
Doll](http://sites.kidrobot.com/munnyworld/?p=gallery). Hopefully next
time we can see the design executed!

Ryan heroically migrated a legacy content managment system to a Post
9-11 version of Apache. You are a hero.

When attempting to build an enclosing box for his bike traffic sensor,
Michael remembered that the quickest way to get a job done is to lower
your standards. The new enclosure for his traffic sensor looks like this.

    Enclosure design fulfills dual purposes. It both protects the electronics,
    <em>and</em> it should blend in pretty well being tossed along side
    the LA River.

Dinner was Japanese. Okonomiyaki, often described as a "savory vegetable
pancake", but really it's more of an eggy hash. Also there was cucumber
sesame salad, and miso soup. We ate it all.

Colin and Fernando kind of just hung around and smoked pipes all night.
What the heck guys? Next time Colin is going to bring a recently aquired
espresso machine, in need of a rebuild.

Laura unboxed and started tinkering with her Intel<sup>®</sup> Edison - Arduino.
Apparently she earned it while participating in a hackathon at
[JPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory)
(started by world renwoned Satanist, [Jack
Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)).
Word on the street is she mentioned out little hack night to some Intel
representative, who seems intrigued. A torrent of unholy sponsorship
cash should start flowing any minute! Hail $atan<sup>®</sup>!
