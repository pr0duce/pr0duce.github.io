Another lovely night at our produce lair: We ate a good meal and
embarked on a bunch of diverse projects. Dinner was my old standby, and
long time favorite, beans and greens and cornbread.

Seguing right from dinner, Rachel continued honing her textile skills,
this week working on embroidery.

Colin, continuing his Espresso Machine Odyssey, disassembled the paneling
with the intention of having it powder coated. Anyone know a good local
powder coater?

One screw in the base of the espresso machine was particularly hard to
get at *and* super rusted. Being knowledgeable mechanics who didn't want
to strip this screw, we employed an impact driver. However, the screw
was so rusted, and the impact driver was so cheap, that it sheared off
our driver bit, lodging it into the screw, and rendered the screw
completely useless and utterly stuck.

Embarking on a very ambitious project, these folks are working on
building their very own PCR machine - one component of DNA sequencing.

Drew joined us and had a *really* productive night disassembling and
cleaning his multiple firearms.

Towards the end of the night, some weary hackers refreshed themselves at
the Produce Labs Spa & Swim Club - just one of the many amenities
available to members.
