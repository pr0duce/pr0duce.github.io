This Tuesday marked another gathering of people learning about stuff,
fixing gizmos, and making chotchkies.

Calvin, a new attendee at produce night and web programmer at JPL by
day, worked on a design for his [Munny
Doll](http://sites.kidrobot.com/munnyworld/?p=gallery). Hopefully next
time we can see the design executed!

Ryan heroically migrated a legacy content management system to a post
9-11 version of Apache. You Sir, are a hero.

In an exercise of lowering standards while build an enclosure for his
bike traffic sensing circuit, Michael came up with a new design.

    This particular enclosure satisfies two design goals. Firstly, it
    protects the electronics from the elements. Secondly, it should
    blend in pretty well with the LA River surroundings.

Dinner was Japanese, featuring okonomiyaki, which is often described as
*a savory vegetable pancake*. Really though, it's more of a hash, or
even, *a ball of delicious vegetable garbage*. Ingredients included but
were not limited to cabbage, carrots, taro, shitake, enokitake, lots of
alliums - really, whatever is at hand. This is held together with
several eggs and a bit of flour. It's fried and topped with some tasty
condiments. Also there was some chilled cucumber sesame salad, miso
soup, and a sashimi platter.  At the end there appeared a really
glorious chocolate pastry. It was heard described as *a brownie
inside a croissant* and equally as *super dank*.  We ate it all.

Apart from the Satanic pancake art, Colin and Fernando kind of just hung
around and smoked pipes all night.  What the heck guys? Next time Colin
is going to bring a recently acquired espresso machine, in need of a
rebuild.

Laura unboxed and started tinkering with her Intel<sup>®</sup> Edison -
Arduino.  Apparently she earned it while participating in a hackathon at
[JPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory) (started
by world renowned Satanist, [Jack
Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer))).
Word on the street is she mentioned our little hack night to some Intel
representative, who seems intrigued. A torrent of unholy sponsorship
cash should start flowing any minute! Hail $atan<sup>®</sup>!
