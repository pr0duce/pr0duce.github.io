Colin wants to build a moisture sensing automated watering system for
his outdoor garden. To that end Colin and Fernando paired on getting
[Rasbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed on
Colin's new raspberry pi.  They also soldered on some contact points for
Colin's moisture sensor.
